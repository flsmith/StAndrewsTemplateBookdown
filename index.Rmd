# Preface {-}

```{r, child = "_setup.Rmd", include = F, purl = F, cache = F}
```

An introductory-workshop to the field of statistical modelling in R. The focus will be on how to fit statistical models in R, rather than on the rigorous underlying mathematics. The target audience is anyone who wants to learn how to fit linear models in R. The progression will be linear models, generalised linear models and linear mixed effects models.

## Prerequisites {-}
* Programming basics in R
* MTXXXX

## Learning outcomes {-}

* Understand the key concepts and terminology used in statistical modelling
* Use R to fit linear, generalised linear and mixed effect models in R
* Recognise practical issues with fitting these models
* Checking model fit
* Perform model comparisons

## Recommended reading {-}

I highly recommend the following books:

* [Statistics: An Introduction using R](https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Statistics%3A+An+Introduction+using+R-p-9780470022986)

* [Linear models with R](https://www.crcpress.com/Linear-Models-with-R/Faraway/p/book/9781439887332)
