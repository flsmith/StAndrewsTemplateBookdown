# Methods

We describe our methods in this chapter.

We showed some examples in the introduction (Chapter \@ref(intro))

You can also reference specific sections by giving them a label `{#sectionname}`


And you can add words to the index such as GLM \index{GLM}

## Shiny app



```{r myshiny, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='An eaxmple of a shiny app. you can see a live version at (put url here)', screenshot.opts = list(delay = 5)}
knitr::include_app("https://lindesaysh.shinyapps.io/mt1007_week22/", height='600px')
```


you can use a shiny app embedded in the notes Figure \@ref(fig:myshiny).
