# Final Words

We have finished a nice book.

If you want to split the book by sections, so each html page is a section you can use split_by='section' in the YAML header. 

```
output: 
   bookdown::gitbook:
    lib_dir: "book_assets"
    config:
      sharing: null
    split_by: section
```

## So what are all the files?

**Main files**

+ `index.Rmd`. This is the main Rmd file where you can set the tile and many of the build options
+ `_bookdown.yml`. This file allows you to choose which chapters to include under which build (gitbook or pdf). You can also specify the book file name and outputs directory. This is necessary if using the task/solution chunks.

**Chapter files**

The first three files contain all the content for your book.  The references and appendix files do not need to be changed. These ensure that you have a references section and the appendix with solutions to the tasks. Each chapter must begin with a single "#" level header (e.g. `# Introduction` at the top of the first file). 

+ `01-intro.Rmd`
+ `02-bellsandwhistles.Rmd`
+ `03-summary.Rmd`
+ `04-references.Rmd`
+ `05-ch_appendix.Rmd` *Don't Edit*

**Bibliography files**

+ `book.bib`. This .bib file is where you place your references. 
+ `packages.bib`. This .bib file is created from the last part of code in the index.Rmd file.  It compiles the citations of the specified packages. 

**Style files**

+ `style.css`. This file describes the styling of the gitbook and includes they style of the "task" elements,the colour of the figure captions etc.  If you want to know the St Andrews colours they are [here](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/brand/design-guidelines/colours/)

**Other files**

+ `_setup.Rmd`. This file creates the "task" elements in markdown. Line 4 of this file sets the global `knitr` options. *Don't Edit except for knitr options*
+ `preamble.tex`. This file loads all the Latex packages necessary for the PDF generation and any new commands. It is like the preamble of a latex document.  Also defined here is how to treat the "task" elements for the PDF document. 
+ `afterbody.tex`. This file specifies that at the end of the PDF, a linked index is created.
+ `toggle.html`. This is a javascript file for rendering the task and solutions. *Don't Edit*

**Git related files**

+ `README.md`. This gives a description on the main github page "lindesaysh/StAndrewsTemplate
+ `.gitignore`. This file tells git which files to ignore during version control (this includes the docs folder and _bookdown folder)
+ `.gitattributes`
